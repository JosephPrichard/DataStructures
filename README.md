# Dstruct

Dstruct is an efficient data structures library written for .NET. It includes alternative implementations of all the common data structures included in the standard library. Dstruct was primarily created as a way for me to better understand commonly used algorithms and data structures.

Includes all the data structures specified below:

### Graph

### Lists
LinkedList, ArrayList, and sorting utilities

### Stack
Linked stack, and stack utilities

### PriorityQueue

### Trees
BinaryTree and AVLTree

### HashTable
